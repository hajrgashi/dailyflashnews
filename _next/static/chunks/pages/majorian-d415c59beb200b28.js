Amber Deffurn, a resident of Castle Bromwich, told BirminghamLive that she \xe2\x80\x9cnever lost hope\xe2\x80\x9d of finding her American Bulldog dog French, writes ilovemydogsomuch Amber alleges that in October 2021, when French was only three months old, he was taken from a family member in Birmingham. On Tuesday night, August 9, the dog warden gave him back. He was still recognizable as her \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful\xe2\x80\x9d boy despite being the \xe2\x80\x9csize of a horse\xe2\x80\x9d and having his ears illegally trimmed.",(0,o.jsx)("img",{src:"https://lolitopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/30-29.jpg",width:615,height:820}),"\xe2\x80\x9cI have other dogs and it was just like, it became a bit of a nightmare I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to walk my other dogs in case they were taken, I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what was happening I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how he was living, it did drive me mental, I felt like I was going insane worrying all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d Amber, 25, said to BirminghamLive. Amber reports that in October, French was \xe2\x80\x9csnatched\xe2\x80\x9d from a family member who was walking him in broad daylight. The incident has not resulted in any arrests, according to West Midlands Police, and Amber has stated that the dog warden is looking into it. \xe2\x80\x9cUsually you don\xe2\x80\x99t get the dog back, a lot of people told me you need to give up because you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to see him again, I just thought I only really had hope left,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amber, who shares her home with her daughter and three other pets. Sadly, Amber believes French\xe2\x80\x99s ears were cut in an illegal procedure called \xe2\x80\x9ccropping.\xe2\x80\x9d",(0,o.jsx)("img",{src:"https://lolitopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/31-28.jpg",width:615,height:820}),"\xe2\x80\x9cI had hundreds of leaflets printed out, I was taking them door to door, we were driving around different areas late at night to see if anyone was walking him.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt looks like his ears were cut off with a Stanley blade, it looked like back yard job,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. She added that the French returned caked in mud and dirt. And he appeared entirely different from the tiny puppy he was in October to the adult he is now: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s massive, he\xe2\x80\x99s like a horse, they did say to me do you want him back because he is massive I said obviously, I\xe2\x80\x99ve looked for him for 10 months, I was worried when he came back, I thought I don\xe2\x80\x99t know him now, but he\xe2\x80\x99s the calmest out of all my dogs, he\xe2\x80\x99s so chilled.\xe2\x80\x9d Amber thought back to the moment she learned the warden had discovered French: \xe2\x80\x9cCanine Search called me.
